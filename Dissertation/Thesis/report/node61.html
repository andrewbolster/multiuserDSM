Comments on GPGPU</A>
</H1><SMALL CLASS="SMALL">
The results of development and implementation of GPU-bound algorithms show that CPU behaviour can be closely modelled GPU, with impressive performance improvements, but that those improvements come at a price of accuracy, and are far from linear in terms of performance efficiency; as demonstrated in the precipitous falls in efficiency in ISB and OSB when using higher numbers of devices.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">The decision to develop a paired PyCUDA-CUDA implementation was a double-edged sword; architectural development was very fast and stayed close to the original structure of the algorithms, but the combination of PyCUDA's own deficiencies in terms of CUDA debugging, poor internal support for Python as a language in general, my own lack of significant experience in either Python or CUDA, and CUDA's inherent abstract complexity, made the entire project harder than it truly needed to be.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">What is clear from going through this process is that GPU development, and CUDA especially, is technically challenging. The process of development was hampered at many points; QUB is not currently suitably equipped for advanced development in this area, with several service outages delaying development by weeks, but even over the course of this project, this state of affairs is improving; new systems are coming online for HPC use; more students are taking advantage of modules such as CSC4005/CSC7007, which includes a CUDA programming component; more and more research clusters are turning to GPU for performance to get over the 'hump' in Moore's Law.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">The plummeting price of GPGPUs, and the increasing competition between different manufacturers means that as computation units, GPU's represent a great opportunity for serious investigation into how to leverage their inherent power in a way that is accessible to more than just a select group of CUDA gurus.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">In short, I believe that GPGPU has the potential to become a major component of the software engineering domain, but in order for widespread growth, additional programming tools and education are badly required, and as such remains a technical and academic curiosity outside of advanced computation centres. This project has demonstrated that amazing performance gains can be obtained, but at a severe cost of development complexity. 
</SMALL>
