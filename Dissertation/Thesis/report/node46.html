OSB GPU</A>
</H2><SMALL CLASS="SMALL">
In the OSB solution, the full permutation range is sliced based on the maximum efficient capacity of the device being used; this generally allows for a maximum three-line solution to be found in 'one shot', but since OSB permutations are computationally explosive, often the kernel triplet is executed many times to span this permutation range to arrive at an optimal solution for a single channel.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">This kernel triplet consists of:
<BR>

<BR>
The reason for the separation is partly logically and partly technical; the generation of A and B matrices is made parallel in both the permutation and line ranges, as each A/B generation shares many values for each respective permutation. Therefore the block and grid dimensions for CUDA execution were set so as to enhance memory coalescing and column-major shared memory accesses; each 'block' calculates one permutation, and each thread within the block calculates one row of A and B. The Solving and LK generation kernels do not easily exhibit this level of parallelism and as such are executed under a thread-share model; i.e. each thread is independent but grouped as a 'best attempt' at efficient memory access.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">As this algorithm operates on a per-channel basis, the major input data (the cross-talk gain matrix) can stay resident on the device for the complete execution of one channel, reducing the time spent transferring data to and from the device. Additionally, this algorithm allows access to not only the optimised bit-load, but also to the PSD of that bit-load, which remains resident in device memory. This reduces repeat-calculations.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">After each kernel execution, as CUDA has no rational way to perform linked-reductions (such as <!-- MATH
 $\text{argmax}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">argmax</SPAN>), the device array containing LK values is returned to the host, and the maximal LK-permutation found from the array-index. If this LK value exceeds the current global maximal LK, then the PSD for that value is also pulled from the device, and returned to the calling function.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">The multi-device extension to this implementation is a simple queue-based channel distribution across devices, as discussed previously. An attempt was made to distribute permutation slices instead of channels, but due to excessive memory redundancies (i.e the same cross-talk gain matrix having to be constantly sent to the host) this implementation was significantly slower that the channel-distributed model<A NAME="tex2html114"
