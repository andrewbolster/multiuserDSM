Development of generalised multi-device function queue</A>
</H3><SMALL CLASS="SMALL">
A GPU device and a host process must be paired, i.e., one host-bound process can execute CUDA kernels on only one GPU device <A NAME="tex2html110"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot2413"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">20</SPAN></SUP></A>. This restriction, coupled with Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python byte-codes simultaneously<A NAME="tex2html111"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot2414"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">21</SPAN></SUP></A>, requires that for multiple GPU devices to me leveraged, additional multi-processing structures must be used.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">There are two major families of multiprocessing structures in Python; one that leverages system threads, like Unix pThreads, in a module called 'threading', and a second that uses full processes, akin to OpenMP. The threading model was selected as the use of multiple processes requires that the entire application (or at least the sections of the application that must deal with multiprocessing) be immutable. This disallows the use of class instance methods (such as all of the bundle and algorithm class functions). Further, processes are significantly 'larger' in terms of memory allocation, and significantly slower in terms of process forking, when compared to the lightweight threading model.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">As such, the generated GPU class, was augmented with a secondary class of persistent GPU threads. These objects, once instantiated with a GPU device index on application start-up, wait on work items to be put one a queue by the GPU parent class. Once a work item is received, the appropriate internal method for each algorithm is selected and executed on the GPU to which it has been instantiated. The advantage of this queueing method is that work is inherently balanced across devices without any declared load-balancing algorithm since as soon as each thread has completed its current work item and returned its results to the parent class, it simply picks the next free item from the queue.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">The overheads incurred in this process are insignificant, and generally hidden; since CUDA executions are none blocking (i.e. unless told explicitly to wait, a host process can continue to process other information during kernel running time), and that these threads are persistent. This persistence is important, since in the single GPU model, each method execution the GPU device must be reinitialised every time the method is called. With this threading model, each device is initialised once during application start-up, and this initialisation time can be hidden behind other work being done such as the generation of the bundle channel matrix.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">Further, this threading model allows the application to be device and system agnostic; automatically adapting to a single, twin, or quad-device system with no user action. This combined with the previously mentioned near-optimal workload calculation could even allow for mixed device systems<A NAME="tex2html112"
